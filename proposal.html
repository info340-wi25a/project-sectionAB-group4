    <title>Rent-A-Tool Project Proposal</title>

    <h1>Problem/Data Domain</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Many people own tools or equipment (e.g., ladders, power washers, party supplies) that they use infrequently.
        Meanwhile, others need these tools for short-term use but are unwilling to buy them due to high costs or
        limited storage. Existing rental platforms (like Home Depot rentals) often have limited inventory and higher
        prices. Additionally, local peer-to-peer sharing platforms are fragmented or nonexistent.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Problem</h2>
    <p>Thereâ€™s no cohesive solution enabling peer-to-peer renting for underutilized tools and equipment in local
        communities. Users face challenges finding nearby tools at reasonable prices or renting their own unused
        items securely. Current solutions lack seamless user interfaces, proper data organization, and persistence.
    </p>

    <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Home Depot Tool Rentals: Expensive for short-term use; lacks user-to-user interaction.</li>
        <li>Facebook Marketplace/Nextdoor: Offers some rentals but lacks structured booking and secure processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our app addresses these gaps by providing a niche, user-friendly, community-focused tool-sharing platform.</p>

    <h1>App Description</h1>
    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>Rent-A-Tool is a web application connecting users looking to rent tools or equipment with those offering unused
        items. The platform provides an intuitive interface for browsing, booking, and managing rentals with secure
        and persistent data storage.
    </p>
